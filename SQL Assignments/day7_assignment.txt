Note: please do not use any functions which are not taught in the class. you need to solve the questions only with the concepts that have been discussed so far.

1- Run below table script to create icc_world_cup table:

create table icc_world_cup
(
Team_1 Varchar(20),
Team_2 Varchar(20),
Winner Varchar(20)
);
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('India','SL','India');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SL','Aus','Aus');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SA','Eng','Eng');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Eng','NZ','NZ');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Aus','India','India');

 write a query to produce below output from icc_world_cup table.
team_name, no_of_matches_played , no_of_wins , no_of_losses


2- Run below script to create drivers table:

create table drivers(id varchar(10), start_time time, end_time time, start_loc varchar(10), end_loc varchar(10));
insert into drivers values('dri_1', '09:00', '09:30', 'a','b'),('dri_1', '09:30', '10:30', 'b','c'),('dri_1','11:00','11:30', 'd','e');
insert into drivers values('dri_1', '12:00', '12:30', 'f','g'),('dri_1', '13:30', '14:30', 'c','h');
insert into drivers values('dri_2', '12:15', '12:30', 'f','g'),('dri_2', '13:30', '14:30', 'c','h');

write a query to print below output using drivers table. Profit rides are the no of rides where end location of a ride is same as start location of immediate next ride for a driver
id, total_rides , profit_rides
dri_1,5,1
dri_2,2,0


3-write a query to print below output from orders data. example output
hierarchy type,hierarchy name ,total_sales_in_west_region,total_sales_in_east_region
category , Technology, ,
category, Furniture, ,
category, Office Supplies, ,
sub_category, Art , ,
sub_category, Furnishings, ,
--and so on all the category ,subcategory and ship_mode hierarchies

solve below questions. You can write SQLs and verify on the platform itself.

Since these are common credentials . If you already see any solution writeen, please remove it and try to write your query.

Note : The platform supports only postgreSQL so there may be few diffrences in functions. Listing down some important diffrences:

SQL server -> postgreSQL
to extract a part of the date
datepart(day,order_date) -> extract (day from order_date)

to convert datetime/timestamp field to date or any other type of type casting 
cast(order_date as date) -> order_date::date
